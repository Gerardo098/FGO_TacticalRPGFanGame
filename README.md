Macewan University CMPT 496 final project

My final project for Macewan University's Bachelor of Science, Computer Science Major.

It is a turn-based, tactical role-playing-game version of the popular mobile game Fate/Grand Order. It is not a 1:1 remake of the game; more of a fan-made work with a new story line and characters. It is also an experiment of my own, taking a tabletop RPG system of my own design and recreating it in a digital, video game format. At the moment, I am aiming to complete the first chapter of the story to serve as a demo.

The game is being made using Unity and C#.
